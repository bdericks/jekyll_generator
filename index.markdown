<a href="http://github.com/drnic/jekyll_generator">jekyll_generator</a> is awesome.

It is a nice generator for a Jekyll website including Disqus comments integration.

Examples
========

* [http://drnic.github.com/macruby-tmbundle](http://drnic.github.com/macruby-tmbundle)
* [http://drnic.github.com/jekyll_generator](http://drnic.github.com/jekyll_generator) (this site)

Usage
=====

    cd to/your/project
    jekyll_generator website --title "Name of Project"
    cd website
    jekyll
    open _site/index.html

It is assumed that your project is already a git repository stored on github. The generators
all use this assumption to derive information about the project.

Requirements
============

* jekyll - this is not installed with jekyll_generator itself

    sudo gem source http://gems.github.com/
    sudo gem install mojombo-jekyll

Installation
============

    sudo gem install jekyll_generator
