**This website** was generated by itself.

The sexy theme. The Disqus comments integration and the sexy comments badge in the sidebar. Blog posts showing in the sidebar. All generated.

[jekyll\_generator](http://github.com/drnic/jekyll_generator) is awesome. It is a nice generator for a Jekyll website including Disqus comments integration and some clean themes.

Examples
========

* [http://drnic.github.com/macruby-tmbundle](http://drnic.github.com/macruby-tmbundle)
* [http://drnic.github.com/jekyll\_generator](http://drnic.github.com/jekyll\_generator) (this site)

Usage
=====

    cd to/your/project
    jekyll_generator website --title "Name of Project"
    cd website
    jekyll
    open _site/index.html

It is assumed that your project is already a git repository stored on github. The generators
all use this assumption to derive information about the project.

Requirements
============

`jekyll` - this is not installed with jekyll_generator itself so to install it:

    sudo gem source http://gems.github.com/
    sudo gem install mojombo-jekyll

Installation
============

    sudo gem install jekyll_generator
